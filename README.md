## Adib

- Django requires a lot of setup so we ended up choosing FastAPI
- Learned how to create my own way to log requests to better debug
- Never ever mutate computed properties!

# To do

- create a rest api
- make sure we can interact it through our frontend
- create the data visualizations, temperature and date of the week, day of the week, city

- frontend will have a table to display city data
  -- headers include Day, average temp for the day, temp range, chance of precipitation
